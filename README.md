# Django-based-Professor-Appointment-and-Scheduling-System
Designed and developed a web application utilizing Django framework, offering an integrated solution for accessing and managing professor schedules. The platform allows users to view, reserve, and request appointments through an intuitive interface. Implemented a notification system to inform professors about pending appointment requests, enabling them to accept or decline based on provided reasoning. Additionally, incorporated a barcode-based access system for professors' rooms, streamlining the process of attending scheduled appointments. This project showcases proficiency in full-stack development, user experience design, and efficient communication features.
